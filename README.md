# Setup

First of all, you'll need an up-to-date version of Xcode, so install that from the Apple app store.

Then, once inside the directory for this project, run the following:

    npm install -g react-native@latest
    brew install cocoapods
    pod install
    npm install
    npx react-native run-ios

This should start up an iPhone simulator. Let me know if you have any questions!
